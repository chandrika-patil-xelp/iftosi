                            <p> Hearts and Arrows in diamond design and cut refers to a particular pattern involving perfect symmetry
                                and angles. Effects such achieved in combination with several factors including pattern positioning,
                                shape and spacing contribute to determining a diamond’s visual appeal and, hence, the pricing. When a
                                diamond cutter uses certain specifications during his artistry, the hearts and arrows pattern are visible
                                upon using special magnification and specific viewer tools; for example, the H&amp;A Viewer.</p>

Pink areas represent areas of less brightness. Dark areas indicate areas where light is blocked by the viewers head (these areas are perceived as dark flashes, or scintillation, when the viewer or the diamond moves). Finally, white areas indicate where light is traveling through the diamond, and 'leaking' out of the bottom (perceived as dull or dark areas in the diamond). Different types of viewers will use different color schemes, but all produce similar patterns.</p>

The hearts and arrows phenomenon quickly spread from Japan to the U.S in the early 1990s. The hearts and arrows pattern is now so popular that many diamond manufactures cut to a specification that will yield this particular pattern, even at the expense of overall cut quality.</p>

Often the presence of the hearts and arrows pattern is taken as confirmation that the diamond is well cut. This is not necessarily true. In a round diamond, a clearly defined set of 8 hearts and 8 arrows is a sign of excellent optical symmetry, an important component of cut. As such, its appearance is a very likely a sign of superior cut, but not a guarantee.</p>

                            <p>The hearts and arrows pattern has gained prominence over the years to become one of the most
                                desirable characteristics in the recent times. Consumers and diamond evaluators worldwide have
                                attached so magnified importance to the pattern that a cut with optimal symmetry in the hearts and
                                arrows pattern is often viewed as a testimony of perfection while cutters too have sacrificed the overall
                                cut quality to achieve the pattern.</p>
                            <p>However, we at IFtoSI believe that this should be viewed as an opinion blurred by magnified marketing
                                of the importance of the pattern. While the presence of the hearts and arrows in diamonds definitely
                                adds to the overall brilliance of the stone, the pattern should not be weighed too much to determine the
                                quality and value of a diamond.</p>
<!--                            <p>For consumers, the greatest benefit of the popularity of hearts and arrows is actually the increased attention brought to the grading of cut. In the late 90s, major labs (including GIA) quickly perceived the demand for a cut grade by customers newly educated to the importance of cut and symmetry in the overall appearance of a diamond. Today, independent laboratory cut grades are the single biggest factor in helping customers to distinguish quality (beyond color and clarity) in diamonds.</p>-->

                                                    <p>GIA does not recognize hearts and arrows as a component of cut grade. This is partly due to the fact that the presence of the pattern is not a guarantee of cut. Occasionally you will see a hearts and arrows notation on a GIA certificate. This is simply GIA noting that an H&A inscription is present on the girdle of the diamond. This is provided as information only, not as a confirmation of the presence or quality of any hearts and arrows pattern in the diamond itself.</p>

                                                    <p>At IFtoSI, we believe the best approach to hearts and arrows is not to be carried away by the marketing of the pattern. One of the reasons GIA (and AGS) do not incorporate or acknowledge H&A in their grading is that it has never been shown to be preferred by consumers in blind tests. While the pattern has an emotional appeal, its actual affect on appearance is debated.</p>
