                            <p>Symmetry in a diamond points to the precision involved in the cut design of the stone facets. Contrary to
                                popular belief inconsistent symmetry does not represent poor cutting design. The cutter here introduces
                                willful imperfections to optimize the weight of the stone as minimal variance in weight influences a
                                diamond’s perceived quality value and the actual price. For example, a diamond with “Good” symmetry
                                and weighing 1 carat will be more sought after than a piece with “Excellent” symmetry but weighing, say
                                0.97 weight.</p>
<!--                            <p>A diamond with poor symmetry may misdirect light that travels into the diamond, sending it off at slightly wrong 
                            <p>angles, and thereby reducing the diamond's brilliance. Often, a diamond cutter will purposefully allow a minor reduction in symmetry as a way of preventing a defect present in the rough stone from being retained as part of the finished diamond.</p>
                            <p>Each IFtoSI Diamond displays the symmetry grade as determined by the GIA, using the following scale:</p>-->

                            <p>Like all other grading parameters, symmetry should not be the sole deciding factor when buying a
                                diamond from your preferred jeweler. A good looking diamond is a combination of excellent polish and
                                excellent symmetry. However, a diamond does not automatically become desirable only with a perfect
                                combination of these two; a poor Cut design will impact the value and appearance of the diamond. On
                                the other hand, excellent Cut design in combination of good symmetry and good polish will makes a
                                diamond desirable.</p>
                                <!--                            <p>Symmetry is more important in diamonds of VVS2 Clarity and higher, since the very subtle defects produced by Fair or Poor symmetry (which can resemble pinpoint inclusions) would compromise the diamond's otherwise flawless appearance.</p>
                                                            <p>Despite its modest impact on appearance, symmetry has a significant impact on price; a diamond with Excellent Symmetry and Polish may be priced 10%-15% higher than a diamond with Good Symmetry and Polish. This premium has more to do with consumer's perceived value of "excellent" grades, than the actual effect on a diamond's appearance.</p>
                                                            <p>Because diamonds with Poor symmetry have defects visible to the naked eye, these diamonds should be avoided in all cases. For this reason, IFtoSI does not carry diamonds with a symmetry grade of Poor.</p>
                                                            <p>A diamond should not be chosen or rejected based solely on symmetry. Because the overall Cut grade already incorporates symmetry, it should be used as the primary determinant when choosing a diamond. When comparing two diamonds of equal Cut grade, symmetry (and polish) can then be used as a further refinement or tie breaker.
