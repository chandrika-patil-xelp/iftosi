                                Jewellery care begins with the buying process itself. Donâ€™t settle for an average quality make at an apparent bargain. Purchasing good quality and certified jewellery reduces its chances of wear and tear beforehand.

                                When not in use, always keep the jewellery back into its original case or store each piece of jewellery separately in a compartmentalized jewellery box to prevent scratches or entanglement.

                            If you want to enjoy the pleasures of your bejeweled treasures for a long time, regular cleaning is important. Besides occasional-wear jewellery, even the daily wear jewellery needs a cleaning round since it is exposed to sweat, oil etc and can suffer discoloration.

                        <p class="font13">Here are some jewellery cleaning tips:</p>

                                Always use warm and not hot water to clean jewellery, as hot water can discolor your jewellery. Use a couple drops of mild liquid detergent, such as baby shampoo and rinse thoroughly with clean water. 
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                When using toothbrush to clean jewellery, ensure that the bristles are soft, as hard bristles can loosen the stones from their settings.   
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                Dry it completely and lightly buff with a soft chamois cloth. Avoid tissue or paper towels because the fibers in it can cause scratches. Also use a lengthwise motion when washing or drying the jewellery, as a circular motion often causes scratching.

                                   Instead of ammonia or detergent, you can use any special jewellery cleaning liquid available at jewellers. Read labels carefully before buying.

                                   Diamonds have an affinity for grease and should be cleaned monthly to keep the fire at its brightest. Every year or so, give your diamond jewellery for professional cleaning. Jewellers use ultra sonic or steam cleaning and will also check the setting, so that the stone does not fall out.
