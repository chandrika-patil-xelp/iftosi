                            <p>The cone-shaped bottom-most part of the diamond is the culet of it. A culet can be flat-surfaced or
                                pointed based on the choice of the diamond cutter and sometimes based on the culture of the target
                                market for the gemstone. Pointed culet is usually preferred, but it is susceptible to damage due to the
                                sharpness at the end. While experts continue to debate whether a culet should there in a diamond, it is
                                left to individual customers to make their choice.</p>

                            <p>Notably, culet is created to enhance the aesthetics; it is not necessarily present on all diamonds. And at
                                the same time, it makes no difference to its quality. While a small culet adds to the diamondâ€™s beauty
                                and contributes to its protection, a larger culet impacts on how the stone looks.</p>
                            <p>Usually, the culet size is determined by following the grades:</p>
