                                The most commonly chosen variation, round-cut diamonds have been more researched by certified gemologists than other shape. Renowned for its unrivaled fire and brilliance, this cut boasts excellent light refraction properties, causing it to appear brighter than other shapes. When clarity and color are equal, a round diamond will be more valuable than alternative shapes.

                                Exuding elegance, pear-shaped diamonds (also referred to as a 'drop cut' or 'teardrop' diamonds) are cut to resemble a drop of water with a single point and rounded end, resulting in a cross between a round and marquise cut. There is some variation among pear-cut diamonds, with some appearing wider and others exhibiting a longer, narrower shape. Pear diamonds are noted for their slenderizing effect, creating the illusion of longer, more tapered fingers. They are also renowned for their high levels of brilliance, boasting 58 radiant facets.

                                Living up to its name, the heart-cut diamond has become synonymous with love and affection, making it an excellent choice for an anniversary or engagement ring.<br>
                                The Heart-Shaped Diamond is considered the most romantic of all diamond cuts., because they are cut with triangular and kite-shaped facets, causing light to when reflected back. A Heart-Shaped Diamond generally contains 59 facets, and is cut much the same way that a Pear-Shaped Diamond is. Often, a diamond cutter will cut a Heart-Shaped Diamond because the cleft at the top of the heart is a way of cutting out inclusions without losing carat weight.

                                A square stone with 90-degree corners, the princess cut originated in the United States in 1980. This shape is one of the most efficiently produced types of diamonds, with nearly 60% of the original rough preserved during the cutting process. The most desirable princess diamonds are perfectly square in shape, with the more rectangular variations decreasing in value.

                                A 57 facet diamond, the Asscher cut diamond was developed at a time when the round brilliant diamond was the common diamond shape.
                                The Asscher cut was developed in 1902, coming in the beginning of the Art-Deco movement that embraced and championed the straight lined geometric form. Its square, step cut shape was the forerunner of the later emerald cut shape of diamond.

                                There’s no denying the timeless elegance of a marquis-cut diamond. Reputed to have been specially made for King Louis XIV of France, who wanted a diamond that simulated the smile of Marquise de Pompadour, this elongated stone has gracefully pointed ends for a dramatic appeal. Due to their extended length, marquise diamonds have more size per carat weight than other shapes and boast a brilliant 58 facets. This cut’s flattering effect creates the illusion of long, slender fingers.
                                Every diamond shape has a length-to-width ratio, which determines how a diamond will appear when viewed from above. When selecting a marquise shaped diamond, look for a length-to-width ratio between 1.7 and 2.3.

                                Timeless and classic, an oval-cut diamond is flattering to most any wearer, creating the illusion of a longer, more slender finger. Cut with the same number of facets as a round diamond, an oval shape emits nearly the same level of brilliance and fire, and its elongated shape makes it appear larger in carat weight than a round.

                                Relatively new to the jewelry industry, radiant diamonds were introduced a little more than 20 years ago. This unique shape is a stunning hybrid of a traditional round-cut and an elegant emerald-cut, resulting in a square, near-square, or rectangular orientation.

                                First introduced into the jewelry market in 1830, the long-standing cushion diamond is rooted in mining history. Cut into a square or rectangular shape with rounded corners and sides, it's considered by many to be a softer version of the emerald cut. Possessing a character-rich antique look, the cushion-cut diamond is a favorite of those who prefer vintage-style rings and jewelry.
